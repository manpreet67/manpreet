  <h2 style="color:red; background: yellow;"  >Govt, Opposition end stalemate in Rajya Sabha over PM's "conspiracy with Pak" remarks</h2>
  

  <h3 style="color:white;" ><img src="C:\Users\home\Desktop\m.png"  width="400" height="400" align="left">NEW DELHI: The stalemate in Parliamentover Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks against his predecessor Manmohan Singh and others at a poll rally in Gujarat ended today, with the government saying the commitment of the former Prime Minister was not questioned.


The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament were repeatedly disrupted over the past week on the issue, with the Opposition demanding an explanation from the Prime Minister over his "conspiracy with Pak" remarks and seeking an apology.

In Rajya Sabha, Leader of the House ArunJaitley said the Prime Minister did not question his predecessor's commitment to India.

<p>When the Upper House reconvened at 2 PM after adjournment due to protests over union minister AnanthkumarHegde's controversial remarks on secularism and changing the Constitution, Jaitley said the Prime Minister in his statements or speeches "did not question the commitment to this nation either by Dr Manmohan Singh, the former Prime Minister, or Hamid Ansari, the former Vice President".

"Any such perception is completely erroneous. We hold these leaders in high esteem, as also their commitment to this nation," Jaitley said.

He said many statements had been made on all sides during the elections, and added that the government "does not want the stalemate as a result of this to continue".

Responding to his statement, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said: "I want to thank the Leader of the House that he issued a clarification on the issue which was causing the deadlock for the last one week."</p>

  WhatsApp has served a legal notice by a New Delhi-based lawyer, asking the company to remove the middle finger emoji from its platform. The lawyer, Gurmeet Singh, says in the legal notice the concerned emoji shows a lewd and obscene gesture, which is a crime in India. The notice says WhatsApp has 15 days to remove the emoji, after which a civil or criminal case may be filed against the Facebook-owned app.</p>

Facebook has started asking a small number of people joining the platform to use their ‘names as per Aadhaar’ on the site. This is only a prompt and not a mandatory requirement, so if the users choose to, they can enter any name while signing up. Moreover, Facebook has not asked for any Aadhaar-related information yet, such as the UIDAI number. Only a small number of new users signing up for Facebook will see this prompt, and that too only on the mobile site, the company said in a statement to Gadgets 360.

  South Africa crushed Zimbabwe by an innings and 120 runs inside two days in their one-off day-night Test at St George's Park on Wednesday. Forced to follow on after being bowled out for 68 in their first innings, Zimbabwe were shot out for 121 runs in their second innings. The match ended before the scheduled dinner break on the second day. Fast bowler Morne Morkel was the destroyer in the first innings, taking five for 21, but medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj engineered the second-innings collapse.
Phehlukwayo took three for 13 and Maharaj claimed five for 59, with stand-in captain AB de Villiers seemingly using his front-line fast bowlers sparingly so they could take advantage of the helpful conditions under floodlights. In the end they weren't needed.
Zimbabwe put up a fight at the start of their second innings, reaching 54 before they lost their first wicket, although opening batsman Hamilton Masakadza was forced to retire hurt after being struck on the right elbow by a ball from Morkel.
The total reached 75 for one before the innings imploded, with four wickets falling in 14 balls. The last nine wickets fell for 46 runs in 15.4 overs.
South Africa needed just 68 minutes and 14.1 overs on Wednesday to take Zimbabwe's remaining six first-innings wickets after they resumed on 30 for four.
Nightwatchman Kyle Jarvis was the top scorer for Zimbabwe, making 23.
Morkel, who took the first three wickets under floodlights on Tuesday, again made the first breakthroughs.<p>
With his seventh ball of the morning, Morkel bowled left-hander Ryan Burl for 16, beating the batsman for pace with a ball angled in from around the wicket.
Four balls later he had Sikandar Raza caught behind after softening him up with a vicious bouncer, which Raza fended off the splice of his bat just short of gully.
Faced with almost an hour to bat before tea, Zimbabwe showed greater resistance in their second innings but Morkel remained a threat. Masakadza, who was out first ball to the tall fast bowler in the first innings, was hit on the elbow when the ball lifted off a good length and beat his forward defensive stroke.
Chamu Chibhabha and Craig Ervine saw their team through to tea but the fight soon evaporated.
South Africa were again without wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, who suffered a low grade hamstring strain while batting on Monday. De Kock was ruled out of the rest of the match, with captain AB de Villiers keeping wicket.
De Villiers held three catches behind the stumps, taking his total of wicketkeeper dismissals to 101 in 26 of his 107 Test matches. He has also held 104 catches as a fielder in his other 81 appearances.
De Kock is expected to be fit for the first Test against India, starting in Cape Town on January 5.

  <h2 style="color:red; background: yellow">; India vs South Africa: Limping Shikhar Dhawan Doubtful for 1st Test </h2>
  <h2 style="color: yellow "> <u> HIGHLIGHTS</u> </h2>
   <ul>
    <li style="color: white">South Africa crushed Zimbabwe by an innings and 120 runs </li>
<li style="color: white">Zimbabwe were shot out for 121 runs in their second innings</li>
<li style="color: white">Morne Morkel was the destroyer in the first innings</li>

</ul>
<h3 style="color:white;" ><img src="C:\Users\home\Desktop\a.png"width="400" height="400" align="left">

Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan raised many eyebrows when he was seen entering the team hotel limping ahead of the team's departure for South Africa tour. Dhawan was seen entering the hotel with his left-ankle heavily strapped. He was accompanied by physio Patrick Farhart. The left-hander has also undergone MRI scan. "Shikhar Dhawan's ankle is being assessed. The physio is yet to give any report to the national selectors. As of now, he is travelling with the team. However, it can't be ascertained whether he will be available for the first Test match or not," a senior BCCI official told PTI on the condition of anonymity.
India were set to depart for South Africa on Wednesday and Dhawan's condition appeared to be a doubtful starter for the opening Test against the Proteas, starting January 5 at Newlands in Cape Town.
If Dhawan is rendered unfit for the first Test, then KL Rahul is expected to open the batting with the dependable Murali Vijay.
As per the selection pattern of the Indian teams whenever there has been an injury concern, the fourth opener currently would be Tamil Nadu's Abhinav Mukund, who had scored 82 in his last Test appearance in Sri Lanka.
Dhawan played two Tests in the home series against Sri Lanka and scored 192 runs at an average of 48.00.
The in-form Vijay was the third highest run-getter in the Test series after Virat Kohli and Dinesh Chandimal. The right-hander scored 292 runs in 2 Tests at an average of 97.33, including two centuries.

  <h2 style="color:red; background: yellow";>Donald Trump Will Fail Against Iran As Did "Smarter" Ronald Reagan: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei   </h2>
  




   
<h3 style="color:white;" ><img src="C:\Users\home\Desktop\u.png" width="400" height="400" align="left"> DUBAI: Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump would fail in his hardened stance towards Iran, saying Tehran was stronger than during the time of the "more powerful and smarter" Ronald Reagan.

"Reagan was more powerful and smarter than Trump, and he was a better actor in making threats, and he also moved against us and they shot down our plane," Khamenei said in a speech carried on state television. 

In 1988, a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf, killing all 290 aboard, in an incident which Washington said was a mistake. Tehran said it was a deliberate attack on Iran, then at war with neighbouring Iraq.

"But Reagan is gone and, according to out beliefs, he now faces God's retribution ... while Iran has made great advances in all areas since Reagan's time," Khamenei added.

"This trend will continue under the current American president and any hopes on their part that the Islamic Republic would back off or weaken is futile."

Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement.

He announced the shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and its support for militant groups in the Middle East.

Under the nuclear deal, sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for Tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential
